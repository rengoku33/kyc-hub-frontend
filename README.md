This is a frontend application (hardcoded JSON instead of API). I completely used AI (chatGPT 4o mini), to be honest... I am the type of guy who uses minimal AI for coding but I wanted to give vibe coding a try

It took me a total of 2 hrs, one shot AI prompt. The vibe coding experience was actually not that great but it was effective in producing results (from generating design to coding the entire project) but after a couple of requests my free usage limit maxed so i patched things up and altered design a little bit and voila!

is this my best work? absolutely not even near... but this is my best and fastest project in 2 hours time frame that i set for myself
